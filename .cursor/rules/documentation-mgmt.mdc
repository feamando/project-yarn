# Rule: Document Classification and Naming Convention
## Goal
To enforce a standardized naming convention for all documentation and reporting documents to maintain organization and easy identification across the project.
## Naming Convention Format
**ALL documents must follow this format:**
```
[[type]]-[[number]]-[[date]]-[[name]]
```
### Document Types
- **TP**: Task Plan
- **CR**: Completion Report  
- **S**: Strategy
- **TH**: Thought Process
- **D**: Project Documentation
### Components
- **Type**: Use the appropriate two-letter code from above
- **Number**: Sequential number (always check existing documents for highest number)
- **Date**: Current date in YYYYMMDD format
- **Name**: Descriptive name using kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
## Process
### Step 1: Determine Document Type
Before creating any document, classify it according to the five types above.
### Step 2: Check Sequential Numbering
**CRITICAL**: Always search existing documents to find the highest number for the document type being created.
Use these search patterns:
- Task Plans: Search for `TP-\d+` pattern
- Completion Reports: Search for `CR-\d+` pattern  
- Strategy: Search for `S-\d+` pattern
- Thought Process: Search for `TH-\d+` pattern
- Documentation: Search for `D-\d+` pattern
### Step 3: Generate Current Date
Use current date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20250730)
### Step 4: Create Descriptive Name
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid special characters except hyphens
## Examples
### Valid Document Names:
- `TP-001-20250730-memory-optimization-implementation`
- `CR-023-20250730-queue-recovery-system-completion`
- `S-005-20250730-aws-integration-strategy`
- `TH-012-20250730-performance-bottleneck-analysis`
- `D-008-20250730-api-reference-guide`
### Directory Structure
Place documents in appropriate directories:
- Task Plans: `.documents/task-plan/`
- Completion Reports: `.documents/completion-reports/`
- Strategy: `.documents/strategy/`
- Thought Process: `.cursor/rules/rapid-prototyping/tasks/`
- Documentation: `docs/`
## Implementation Requirements
### For AI Assistant:
1. **Always apply this rule** when creating any documentation
2. **Always check existing numbers** before assigning a new number
3. **Never skip the numbering validation step**
4. **Use parallel tool calls** to check multiple document types if uncertain
5. **Create directories if they don't exist**
### Required Actions Before Document Creation:
1. Search for existing documents of the same type
2. Identify the highest sequential number
3. Increment by 1 for the new document
4. Apply the full naming convention
5. Verify the path exists or create it
## Validation Checklist
Before finalizing any document name, verify:
- [ ] Correct document type code used
- [ ] Sequential number is properly incremented
- [ ] Date is in YYYYMMDD format
- [ ] Name uses kebab-case
- [ ] Full format follows [[type]]-[[number]]-[[date]]-[[name]]
- [ ] Document is placed in correct directory
## Migration Note
Existing documents that don't follow this convention should be gradually renamed when they are next modified, but this is not a blocking requirement for new document creation.
## Final Instructions
1. This rule MUST be applied to ALL new documentation
2. No exceptions - always use the naming convention
3. Always validate sequential numbering
4. When in doubt, search existing documents first
5. This rule takes precedence over any conflicting naming preferences
