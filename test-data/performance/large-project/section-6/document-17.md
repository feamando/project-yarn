## Section 2: Technical Details

### Subsection 2.1: Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: React TypeScript frontend
- **Application Layer**: Business logic and use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, file system, and external services
- **Core Layer**: Domain entities and business rules

### Subsection 2.2: Performance Considerations

When working with large documents, several factors affect performance:

1. **Memory Usage**: Large documents consume significant memory
2. **Rendering Performance**: Complex markdown rendering can be slow
3. **File I/O**: Reading and writing large files takes time
4. **Database Operations**: Indexing and searching large content
5. **AI Processing**: Embedding generation and similarity search
