# Project Yarn Accessibility Audit Framework
## Task 3.3.3: Comprehensive Accessibility Audit

### Audit Scope and Standards
This accessibility audit evaluates Project Yarn against:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Standards**
- **Section 508 Compliance**
- **Desktop Application Accessibility Guidelines**
- **Keyboard Navigation Requirements**
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**

### Audit Categories

#### 1. Keyboard Accessibility
- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab order is logical and intuitive
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear
- [ ] No keyboard traps exist
- [ ] Shortcuts and hotkeys are documented
- [ ] Modal dialogs handle focus correctly

#### 2. ARIA and Semantic HTML
- [ ] Proper semantic HTML elements used
- [ ] ARIA labels for complex components
- [ ] ARIA roles for custom components
- [ ] ARIA states (expanded, selected, etc.)
- [ ] ARIA properties (describedby, labelledby)
- [ ] Live regions for dynamic content

#### 3. Visual Design and Contrast
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large text)
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Focus indicators have sufficient contrast
- [ ] Text is readable and scalable
- [ ] UI components are distinguishable

#### 4. Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] All content is announced correctly
- [ ] Navigation landmarks are present
- [ ] Headings structure is logical
- [ ] Form labels are associated correctly
- [ ] Error messages are announced
- [ ] Status updates are communicated

#### 5. Motor Accessibility
- [ ] Click targets are at least 44x44px
- [ ] Drag and drop has keyboard alternatives
- [ ] Time limits can be extended/disabled
- [ ] No seizure-inducing animations
- [ ] Hover states have focus equivalents

- [ ] AI suggestion overlay

#### AI Blocks Components
- [ ] AiBlocksManager.tsx
- [ ] AiBlockCard.tsx
- [ ] CreateAiBlockModal.tsx
- [ ] EditAiBlockModal.tsx
- [ ] VariableInputModal.tsx
- [ ] AiBlockStats.tsx

#### UI Primitives
- [ ] Button components
- [ ] Input components
- [ ] Modal dialogs
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Checkbox components
- [ ] Textarea components
- [ ] ScrollArea components

#### Chat Interface
- [ ] StreamingChatUI.tsx
- [ ] Message bubbles
- [ ] Input controls
- [ ] Action buttons

### Testing Tools and Methods

#### Automated Testing Tools
1. **axe-core** - Automated accessibility testing
2. **WAVE** - Web accessibility evaluation
3. **Lighthouse** - Accessibility scoring
4. **Color Contrast Analyzers**

#### Manual Testing Methods
1. **Keyboard-only navigation**
2. **Screen reader testing** (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
3. **High contrast mode testing**
4. **Zoom testing** (up to 200%)
5. **Color blindness simulation**

### Audit Process

#### Phase 1: Automated Scanning
- Run axe-core accessibility tests
- Generate Lighthouse accessibility reports
- Use WAVE browser extension
- Check color contrast ratios

#### Phase 2: Manual Testing
- Navigate entire app using only keyboard
- Test with screen reader (NVDA recommended)
- Verify focus management in modals
- Test form validation and error handling

#### Phase 3: Component-Specific Testing
- Test each component individually
- Verify ARIA implementation
- Check responsive behavior
- Test edge cases and error states

#### Phase 4: Documentation and Reporting
- Document all findings
- Prioritize issues by severity
- Create remediation tasks
- Provide implementation guidance

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (Must Fix)
- Blocks core functionality for assistive technology users
- WCAG AA violations that prevent task completion
- Keyboard traps or inaccessible essential features

#### High (Should Fix)
- Significant usability barriers
- Missing ARIA labels on important elements
- Poor contrast ratios on key content

#### Medium (Could Fix)
- Minor usability improvements
- Enhancement opportunities
- Non-critical ARIA improvements

#### Low (Nice to Have)
- Cosmetic improvements
- Additional accessibility features
- Future enhancement opportunities

### Success Criteria

#### Minimum Requirements (WCAG AA)
- ✅ All functionality available via keyboard
- ✅ Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text), ≥ 3:1 (large text)
- ✅ All images have alt text
- ✅ Forms have proper labels
- ✅ Focus indicators are visible
- ✅ No keyboard traps

#### Enhanced Accessibility Goals
- ✅ Comprehensive ARIA implementation
- ✅ Screen reader optimization
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Reduced motion preferences
- ✅ Scalable text up to 200%
- ✅ Clear error messaging

This framework will guide the systematic accessibility audit of Project Yarn to ensure compliance with WCAG AA standards and optimal user experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
